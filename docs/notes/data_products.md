# Things to ask before starting work on a Data/Machine Learning project.

This is a list of questions I try to answer whenever I start working on a new data/machine learning project.


## Problem statement

Start with understanding the problem that needs to be solved. 

- What is the problem we are solving?
- How are we currently solving it?
- Which are the challenges of the current solution?
- How can we quantify the value of solving the problem?
- Who will use the solution and how?
- What are the costs of error and how can we mitigate them?
- What is the minimum improvement that would create meaningful value?
- Which metrics will we look to determine the success or not?

## Understand the data

Next part is data requirements. Note that some of them can be asked, but in some cases some exploratory work might be needed to answer the questions. This is a good thing, as it can help you understand the problem and the data better.

- What are the data requirements for the solution?
- What is the current and expected data volume?
- What kind of data preprocessing needs to happen?
- What data gaps exist in our current state? How can we close them?

## Design

Feedback from the previous group of questions can be used to start thinking about alternative designs. However, when designing the final solution, it's worth keeping in mind the following items:

- What are the key capabilities required?
- What are the production requirements for the desired solution?
- Which is the best set of technologies to deliver this workload?
- Which additional limitations (if any) exist?

## Project details

- When does this feature need to be delivered?
- When can it begin?
- Which resources or support is required?
- Who will maintain the project post-completion?
- What are the execution risks and how can they be mitigated?
