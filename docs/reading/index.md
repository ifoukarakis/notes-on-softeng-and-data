I enjoy reading a lot. I wish I had more time to read things.

**Books** is the first medium we , I prefer books that can help you understand concepts and ideas or can act as reference. I try to avoid getting printed books for specific programming languages or frameworks.

**Newsletters** are great for keeping up to date with new developments. There's also newsletters where people talk about their experiences or thoughts on specific topics.
