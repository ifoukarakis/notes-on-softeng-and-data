# Books

**Books** are the first medium we learn to read. I prefer books that can help you understand concepts and ideas or can act as reference. I try to avoid getting printed books for specific programming languages or frameworks.

 Here's my selection of topics.

- :fontawesome-solid-circle-nodes: __[Algorithms]__ – Algorithms and Data Structures
- :material-database: __[Data]__ – Books about data and machine learning.
- :material-code-braces: __[Software Engineering]__ – Software engineering.
